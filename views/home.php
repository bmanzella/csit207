        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 14px">
            I would like to personally welcome you to VATSIM North America!
            <br><br>
            VATNA is dedicated to providing quality air traffic control services, while preserving a fun and
            friendly environment for both controllers and pilots alike. We are the largest region on the
            VATSIM network, boasting almost 7,000 controllers and many more pilots who call North America home.
            We are consistently amongst the most-staffed and most-visited airspace anywhere on VATSIM. Our controllers’
            jurisdiction encompasses over 30 countries, and approximately 24 million square miles of oceanic airspace;
            equating to over 80% of the world’s controlled oceanic airspace, and over 15% of the earth’s total surface
            area. Our off-network counterparts lay claim to 23 of the world’s 30 busiest airports by traffic volume.
            Our VATSIM controllers handle much of the same, seeing over 500,000 operations yearly in our airspace.
            Whether you are just looking for a great place to fly, or wanting to begin your virtual air traffic career,
            VATNA is a great place to call home.
