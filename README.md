# Roster Manager
## Abstraction
The Roster Management system provides the user with the ability to manage a simple (yet complex) roster for a team. As an example, we are going to use an organization that I belong to. That organization is the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM). I will specifically focus on a solution for an Air Route Traffic Control Center in the United States Division of the North America Region.

## Databases
The following databases will be utilized:

```
Users: id. name, email, role, department, username, password
```
```
Roles: id, name
```
```
Departments: id, name, manager_id
```
These will be updated once I actually get to working with the databases and have more time.
